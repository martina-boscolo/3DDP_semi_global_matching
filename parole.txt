monocular algo not abe to recover the scale 
we compare sgd with modern thing tomorreow we will se 

aggregation cost is a tensor 
you sum over the number of paths



last number on execution is the max disparity 

at  the end you will see the sispatrity map 

left to right and right to left in order to recaver the sclae function 

no need to get so goood result, maybe you can not, 
get qualitative and quantitatitave result, reaonably 

try to avoid nested loops, your code havs to be very efficient. 

you also have to provide a small reporto
explaining aproach and problem incountred, 
provide numerical result and qualitative results like images 
important not to be slow otherwise slightly pealized
